There are several options for protecting your back:

1. Jacket-integrated back protector: Often less coverage. However, some extend over the lumbar region and/or go lower than the jacket;
2. Stand-alone back protector with shoulder straps: these can provide more coverage than an integrated back protector, but this is not always the case;
3. Protective vest: combines the advantages of a stand-alone back protector with one- or two-piece chest protection, and usually also covers areas such as the malleolus.

<!--more-->

All this equipment is subject to the same EN 1621-2:2014 standard for the back protector. This standard has 2 levels, but level 1 doesn't make much sense: 

- Level 2 is significantly more shock-absorbent (residual energy <9 kN vs <18 kN);
- The increase in thickness or reduction in comfort is negligible;
- The choice of level 2 back protectors is plethoric.

In these conditions, it doesn't seem worthwhile to dwell on level 1s, so I won't do so.

Before going into detail, I'd like to make a few general observations based on what I've read (normally everything is below):

- We tend to focus on protecting the spine, whereas :
    - Impacts to the back are devastating when they affect the kidneys and shoulder blades;
    - Injuries to the spine are more often caused by twisting of the back, at the level of the skull or pelvis, than by a direct impact;
- The very high levels of absorption claimed by some manufacturers are often concentrated in the spine;
- Some back protectors have a very poor history when it comes to accessories (velcro fastenings, shoulder straps, etc.), but also in terms of protection! Foams can lose their properties as they age. Some manufacturers even recommend changing them every 2 years;
- There doesn't seem to have been much of a revolution in the field of back protection since the 2010's, the figures for the greatest absorption remain relatively the same (around 5 kN even for the best models) and the models at the top of the rankings haven't changed much in the last 10 years.


This tells me that you need to pay particular attention to the area covered by the back protector, in addition to its pure absorption capacity.
A back protector with a lot of coverage will also protect the kidneys and shoulder blades, and I imagine it could also prevent some twisting of the spine by limiting movement of the upper back or pelvis.
As far as ageing is concerned, when buying second-hand, apart from the condition of the velcro and straps, I think you should be careful not to buy back protectors that are too old:
Changing every two years seems excessive, but as with helmets, it's probably best to avoid going beyond 10 years (manufacturers like SAS-TEC guarantee their foams for 10 years, for example, while others are more like 5-6 years).
Be careful: many models have been the same for 10 to 15 years and may have slept in a cupboard.


An additional parameter: there aren't just different models, there are also different sizes and shapes for the same models.
Tryonic models vary enormously in shape and don't cover in the same way from one size to another.
Zandona too.


Finally, only Zandona seems to make models suitable for small people (<1m60), so if you're concerned, it's worth checking them out (plus there are quite a few on Vinted).


And on that note, let's move on to the sources.




# Reference readings on back protection :

* [AFMB - protecting your back and thorax](https://afmb.fr/proteger-son-dos-et-son-thorax/) - 2015 article written by a "resuscitating anaesthetist in an orthopaedic-traumatology and spinal pathology department" ;
* [moto-securite.fr - Pourquoi se protéger le dos](https://moto-securite.fr/protection-dos/) - 2015 article written by Dr Lucien Castagnera, Spinal Pathology Unit, Bordeaux University Hospital.  
If you want to avoid using a stand-alone back protector, he suggests a simple solution: sew (or have sewn) a suitable pocket into your jacket, so that you can fit a back protector with better coverage, like the old BMW model (the new one is pictured below);

## FortNine's 2017 Youtube comparison

In a nutshell:

* Integrated back protectors:
    * Forcefield Pro Lite K: 
        * Recommended for protection (5 kN + cover)
        * Heavy (420g) and thick (22mm)
    * D3O VIPER 2: 
        * Recommended for flexibility
        * Lower coverage
        * Protection close to the maximum authorised of 9 kN
        * Does not cope well with cold
    * Alpinestars Nucleon KR:
        * 2i: 7 kN, the lightest (280 g), the most ventilated, but very low coverage ;
        * 1i: the same with a rigid shell in the middle. He thinks it's becoming too rigid for just one more kN of protection;
    * Sas-Tec SC-1/15: 
        * He doesn't recommend it for its stiffness and ventilation.
        * It is however close to 5 kN and has good coverage.
* Stand-alone back protectors:
    * Forcefield Pro L2K EVO: 
        * Protection: 4.8 kN, like a Pro Lite K but extended over the neck, lumbar and tailbone. 
    * Forcefield Pro Sub 4: 3.4 kN lighter but 2x thicker and more expensive.
    * Forcefield EX-K Harness Flite Plus: Similar to the Forcefield Pro L2K EVO with the added shoulders, but the same price and slightly lower protection.

Note: In his view, stand-alones are all more rigid than integrates.



Two interesting comments:

> i can also confirm the sastec is damn hot! and that forcefield l2k is really comfy for even an all day ride!

> love my forcefield pro l2k. don't even notice it once it's on and the kidney belt is fantastic for your lower back on long rides.

## Back protectors with shoulder straps :


**BMW Ruckenprotektor 2 (6.8 kN) :**
Seems to cover shoulder blades, kidneys and tailbone well.

**Dainese N-Frame (6.81 kN/6.5 kN) :**
Seems to cover the shoulder blades, kidneys and a little of the tailbone.

![](<Dainese N-Frame.png> "Dainese N-Frame - source Dainese")


**Dainese Wave Air (7.52 kN) :**
Very low coverage beyond the spine.

**Forcefield Pro LK2 Evo (7.17 kN) :**
Seems to cover shoulder blades, kidneys and tailbone well.

**Forcefield Pro Sub4K (4,26 kN) :**

(source image : [Espaldera de moto Forcefield PRO SUB 4K Back protector](https://www.corver.es/productos/espaldera-de-moto-forcefield-pro-sub-4k-back-protector))

**Komperdell cross (4.97 kN/5.13 kN):**
Seems to cover the shoulder blades and tailbone well, less the kidneys.
Back protector is difficult to find under its original brand, as Komperdell seems to focus mainly on its horse riding jackets and no longer sells motorbike equipment.
On the other hand, white-label models distributed by many brands are easy to find: Vanucci vest at Louis Moto, Held Recia/Salvo, IXS Carapax, etc.

- Vanucci version :

- Held Recia (male version: Salvo) :

**Racer Viper d3o (6.06 kN) :**
Seems very covering, except perhaps at the tailbone.

![](<Racer Viper 2 D3O.png> "Racer Viper 2 D3O")


**Spidi back warrior evo (8,1 kN) :**
Covers the shoulder blades and tailbone, but not the kidneys.

**Tryonic feel 3.7 (5.57 kN) :**
Also sold under the name Vanucci Back 1.1.
Depending on the size the shape changes enormously and so does what it covers, overall the shoulder blades seem exposed at the top, and the kidneys seem poorly protected.


- L size :

- Vanucci model :

![](<Vanucci Back 1.1.png> "Vanucci Back 1.1")

**Zandona shark (6.6 kN/6.5 kN) :**
Special case:
Zandona produces its models in many sizes (X6, X7, X8, X9...) and the width seems to remain identical with the size, so the smaller models seem to provide more coverage for the shoulder blades and kidneys, while the larger models appear narrow.

There are adult sizes from 1m57 upwards, as well as children's models.

- Probably a size > X7 (1m68-1m77) :

(source image : [Amotomio.it - Zandonà Shark Armour GT - test](https://www.amotomio.it/le-nostre-prove/2693-2017-zandona-shark-armour-gt.html))

- In size X6 (1m58-1m67) it looks much wider:

**Zandona spine (6.8 kN) :**
(Same remarks as for the Zandona Shark)

**Zandona Esatech (5.54 kN/4.6 kN):**
Seems to cover the shoulder blades better than its Zandona siblings, but the kidneys are a little left out.
