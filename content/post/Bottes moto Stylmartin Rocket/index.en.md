A short post to give the features of the Rocket boots from Stylmartin because I realized that they were very hard to find on the internet.

In summary:

- Shank height: Level 2 (high)[^1]
- Abrasion resistance: Level 2 (12 s zone B, 2.5 s zone A)
- Puncture resistance: Level 1
- Lateral stiffness: Level 1

For the record, I've owned these boots for 2 years and I'm very happy with them: they ride high, they are waterproof and well built (thick but comfortable leather, laces adjustment protected by a leather band, side zip opening, etc.), the soles grip surprisingly well, and they age well, as shown in the picture above.

I simply maintain them from time to time with _Saphir Universal Cream_ (ex. [at _Valmour_](https://www.valmour.fr/cirage-creme-universelle-saphir.html)).
