Characteristics of the shells :
-----------------------------

- Certification: Level 2 T+ T- [^1]
- Actual protection: The manufacturer does not give a figure. MotoCAP would have (source: [advrider](https://advrider.com/f/threads/ce2-replacement-armor-database-comparison.1466522/)) measured an average of 18,9 kN for the elbow (standard: 20 kN on average, maximum 30 kN)
- Manufacturing: ?
- Advertised life span: ?
- Type of materials: Rigid vulcanized materials, does not adjust with body heat
- Ventilation : Very good


Comfort and comparison with other brands : 
------------------------------------------------

My opinion:
Their main appeal is the combination of great coverage and great ventilation. Other than that the protection is a bit low, and the reviews below say they are not very comfortable.

For less ventilated but more protective (<12 kN), even more covering and half the price, it is interesting to look at SAS-TEC :

- Knees/elbows very large size: [My article on SAS-TEC SC1/06EVO]({{< ref "/post/Protections moto SAS-TEC SC-1-06-EVO/index.md">}})
- Shoulders, knees, elbows large size : [My article on SAS-TEC SC1/EVO1, EVO2 and EVO3]({{< ref "/post/Protections moto SAS-TEC SC-1-EVO1, SC1-EVO2, SC1-EVO3/index.md">}})

And for shoulder and elbow protections that are just as airy, more protective (< 16 kN), a little less covering and half the price too, there are the Alpinestar Bio Air :

### Feedback: Stiffness and unpleasant angles:

> Seeflex is relatively stiff so if you're used to d3O stuff (what Rukka uses), the Seeflex may feel like a brick although d3O isn't exactly the least stiffest of all armor.
> — <cite>[advrider ThrillSeeka](https://advrider.com/f/threads/armor-upgrade-for-rukka.1464303/#post-40753844)

### Feedback: 

> Rev'it's choice of thin square edges for the molds can cause discomfort if pressed against tissue for prolonged periods - frequently cited in Revzilla reviews for the knee in particular
> — <cite>[advrider cblais19](https://advrider.com/f/threads/ce2-replacement-armor-database-comparison.1466522/page-4#post-40913774)</cite>

### Feedback: Comparison with Alpinestars Nucleon Air and Forcefield Isolator 2:

> Material is a hard rubbery compound similar to A* Nucleon Air, but has a slight bit more give to it when pressed hard. The shape is slightly larger then the coverage offered by the Forcefield protector, but that's mainly due to a longer and very thin end piece. 
> — <cite>[advrider cblais19](https://advrider.com/f/threads/ce2-replacement-armor-database-comparison.1466522/page-4#post-40913774)</cite>
> 
### Feedback: Special shape of the shoulder protectors:

> Shoulder protectors from this line are among the most asymmetrical out there with wide scapula coverage, and are unlikely to fit most standard pockets.
> — <cite>[advrider cblais19](https://advrider.com/f/threads/ce2-replacement-armor-database-comparison.1466522/page-4#post-40913774)</cite>
> 
### Feedback: Compatibility with Dainese clothing:

> An inmate reports that the elbow protectors are a perfect replacement for the Dainese hardshell/foam CE1 protectors.
> — <cite>[advrider cblais19](https://advrider.com/f/threads/ce2-replacement-armor-database-comparison.1466522/page-4#post-40913774)</cite>
