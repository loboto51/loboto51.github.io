Note on pant integration (source below):


- C-shaped hip protectors of standard shape and size, they will fit into the pockets provided for (source: [Motorcycle Gear Hub](https://www.mcgearhub.com/motorcycle-armor/alpinestars-nucleon-racing-kr-hr-hip-protectors-review/));
- Protectors supplied with fabric pockets that can be integrated into pants;
- Protectors and pockets equipped with velcro (but it's better to sew the pockets to the pants);


**Idea: Use as a chest protector :**.


Motorcycle Gear Hub indicates that the size and shape allow them to be used as chest protectors, example here: [AGV Sport Willow leather jacket - mcgearhub.com](https://www.mcgearhub.com/motorcycle-jackets/agv-sport-willow-leather-jacket-review-problems-solutions-improvements/)




Comfort and comparison with other brands : 
------------------------------------------------


#### Feedback: Compatibility with existing pockets:

> The dimensions of the Large-sized pads are [...] on point with the universal dimension of the biggest hip pads around (for motorcyclists) and that are also commercialized by the likes of [Rev’It](https://www.mcgearhub.com/motorcycle-pants/revit-tornado-2-pants-review/), [D3O](https://www.mcgearhub.com/tag/d3o-armor/) and Oxford. 
> Furthermore, you will find many motorcycle jeans using Level-1 CE-rated generic hip armor that meets these same dimensions
> — <cite>[Motorcycle Gear Hub](https://www.mcgearhub.com/motorcycle-armor/alpinestars-nucleon-racing-kr-hr-hip-protectors-review/)


### Feedback: Sewing pockets into pants :

> We still recommend that you stitch the pockets (with two rows of threading) into the
inside liner of your pant or jacket for further peace of mind.

### Feedback: Use as chest protection :

> Incidentally, the KR-HR protectors can also be used as chest armor as I’ve done with an [AGV Sport Willow leather jacket](https://www.mcgearhub.com/motorcycle-jackets/agv-sport-willow-leather-jacket-review-problems-solutions-improvements/)
