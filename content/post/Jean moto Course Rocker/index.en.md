This sheet describes my test of the Aramid/Kevlar _Course Rocker_ reinforced jeans sold by the _XLMoto_ website at quite low prices (60 to 80€).

> _NB :_ In "normal" jeans, I basically wear _Grim Tim_ from _Nudie Jeans_ and _Levi's 511_ in size 36, length 32.


The site's chart says that the pants run small, but it's actually the opposite:  
I tried on a 36 (photos) and a 38, the 38 was way too big, the 36 is loose.

(Note: A few months after writing this article, I bought the same jeans in size 34 and it's the right size for me, so one size down from my usual size)_

**General info:**

- Protection level AA** (good);
- Made in Pakistan (bad);
- The fabric of the jeans is very thick, it inspires confidence ;
- It comes with impressive level 1 knee pads and level 2 hip pads, also impressive ;
- The positioning of the knee pads is done by numerous and regularly spaced velcros;
- The aramid cover is in accordance with the photos on the site (seat + knees + a 10 cm wide band along each leg;
- It is very versatile, you can hardly see the shells despite their thickness (see photos);
- It is a little wide, but not so wide that it is shocking.

Dimensions of the pockets for protections:

- Knees: 29 cm (high seam to the lowest velcro) x 18 cm (edge to edge) ;
- Hips: 25 cm x 13 cm.


**My opinion:**

I am very happy with it.

I removed the hip shells which I find too bulky.
I wore it to the office several times with the original knee pads on, without feeling any discomfort. 
Later I replaced these shells by [_SAS-TEC SC-1/KB2_](https://www.sas-tec.de/en/products/sc-1-kb2-new/), thin (1 cm) and much more protective (level 2, <18 kN).

I wear the shells in the highest position (3rd velcro from the bottom).

I deactivated the unused knee velcros, because they tended to close during the day and lock the shells in a bad position: I simply cut pieces of velcro on the hairy side and fixed them on.

Only downside: There are some poorly finished seams in the lining. I'm crossing my fingers that the outer seams will hold better. (Note: Many ports later, nothing to report)_

> _Side reading: For those who are interested in this kind of modification, I did some sewing in the past to integrate the huge SC-1/06EVO_ knee protectors from _Sas-Tec_ into a _DXR Howell City CE_ motorcycle jean, see my article dedicated to these protections: [SAS-TEC SC-1-06-EVO motorcycle protections]({{< ref "/post/Protections moto SAS-TEC SC-1-06-EVO/index.en.md">}}).

Quick review of the _Course Caféman_ (tried in 36 and returned) :
------------------------------------------------

- Protection level A (poor);
- Made in Pakistan (lame);
- The fabric is thick and slightly velvety ;
- It comes with level 1 knee pads;
- Knee pads are positioned by numerous and evenly spaced velcro fasteners;
- The aramid cover is in accordance with the photos on the site (seat + knees + a 10 cm wide band along each leg) ;
- It is very large, I would have had to order it in 34.

Between the look of the fabric, the A level and the size issue, I was not convinced.
