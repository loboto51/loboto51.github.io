Autofocus is usually done by pressing the shutter button halfway down: I focus, I keep the shutter button down to compose my scene, then I press it all the way down to take the picture.

The _"back button focus"_ technique consists in assigning the focus function to another button on the camera (usually at the back, controlled by the right thumb, hence the _"back button"_).
This way I can focus and compose freely, without having to hold down the shutter button.

# I. Test the back-button focus

The EM-5 II allows :

1. Juggle between 2 function configurations between the shutter release and the button to which the **AEL/AFL** (_Auto Exposure Lock_/_Auto Focus Lock_) function has been assigned:
     - mode1" = _"Shutter halfway=AEL/S-AF, shutter full=exposure, AEL/AFL button=AEL"_  
Default operation: half-press shutter locks the exposure (**AEL**) and makes the autofocus single (**S-AF**), the **AEL/AFL** button locks the exposure (**AEL**)
     - "mode 3": _"Half-press shutter=AEL, full-press shutter=expo, AEL/AFL button=S-AF"_   
Back button focus_ : the half-press shutter locks the exposure (**AEL**), the **AEL/AFL** button performs the single autofocus (**S-AF**)
2. To assign this **AEL/AFL** function to almost all the buttons on the camera.

Actions to perform:

---

### I.1. Switch the autofocus to **"mode 3"**.

Your camera is in **S-AF** mode by default, but for those who want to check:

Menu "** button > **"A (AF/AL) "** :

- AF mode** : **S-AF** (autofocus) or **S-AF+MF** (autofocus + manual focus)

NB: Also check that you have:

- Full-time AF** : **Off**

To switch to **"mode 3"** :

Menu "** button > **"A (AF/AL) "** :

- **AEL/AFL** : 
    - MF
    - C-AF
    - S-AF** :
        - mode1" = _"Half-press shutter=AEL/S-AF, full-press shutter=exposure, AEL/AFL button=AEL"_
        - mode3"** = _"Shutter halfway=AEL, full shutter=exposure, AEL/AFL button=S-AF"_

Now the shutter release will not focus. You must assign the **AEL/AFL** function to another button.

---

### I.2. Assign the **AEL/AFL** function to an easily accessible button

No back button being very accessible, I opted for the front button, near the lens, whose logo looks like an iris.

Button **"Menu "** -> **"B (button/dial/lever) "**

- Function "**
    - Iris "** : **AEL/AFL "**

Once this is done, your button should trigger the autofocus.

---

### I.3. Conclusion



To return to the classic release, simply switch AEL/AFL>S-AF back to "mode 1".
The **"AEL/AFL "** button will only lock the exposure ("AEL/AFL=AEL button").

# II. The best of both worlds: Switching between "back button focus" and shutter release MAP with the lever

The _back button focus_ is nice but it's only really useful 10% of the time.

The configuration below aims to switch easily from one mode to the other, using the lever of the camera.

We will use a trick: 

1. The lever can be configured to associate a type of _AF_ to each of its 2 positions (**"mode 5"**): **MF**, **S-AF**, **C-AF**, or **S-AF+MF** ;
2. A different triggering "mode" can be assigned to each type of _AF_ (above we have assigned "mode 3" to **S-AF** only);
3. Tip: In **"mode 3"** the **AEL/AFL** key(s) trigger an autofocus even in manual **"MF "** mode!


We will therefore assign the manual focus (**MF**) to one position of the lever, in **"mode 3"**, and the **S-AF** (or **S-AF+MF**) to the other position, in **"mode 1"** (standard behavior).

### II.1 Setting the lever to switch between 2 types of AF

Button **"Menu "** > **"B (key/dial/lever) "** : **"Function of the lever "** : **"B" (key/dial/lever)

- Lever function "** : **Mode 5"** = "Change the AF mode between custom AF settings 1 and 2

Now move the lever to position 1, set one AF mode, and then to position 2, set another.

Lever in position 1 :

Button **"Menu "** > **"A (AF/AL) "** :

- AF mode** : **S-AF+MF

Lever in position 2:

Menu "** button > **"A (AF/AL) "** :

- AF mode** : **MF**


Now:

When the lever is in position 1, it is in **S-AF+MF**.

When the lever is in position 2, you are in **MF**.

---

### II.2 Assigning **"mode 1"** to **"S-AF "** and **"mode 3"** to **"MF "**.

Menu button "** > **"A (AF/AL) "** :

- AEL/AFL "** :
    - MF "** : **mode3"** = _"Shutter button halfway AEL, Shutter button full=exposure, AEL/AFL : S-AF"_
    - C-AF
    - S-AF "** : **mode1"** = _"Shutter button halfway AEL/S-AF, Shutter button full=exposure, AEL/AFL button: AEL"_

Now: 

When the camera is in **MF** (lever in position 1), the shutter button operates normally.

When the camera is in **S-AF** or **S-AF+MF** (position 2), the camera in _back button focus_.
