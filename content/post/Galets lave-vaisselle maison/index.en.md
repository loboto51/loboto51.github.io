I make my dishwasher tablets with the recipe from the article [lilycraftblog - Making homemade dishwasher tablets](https://lilycraftblog.com/faire-des-tablettes-lave-vaisselle-maison/).
This mixture works well, the glasses stay clear and the dishes are clean.

**Ingredients for about 20 tablets:**

- 60 g of citric acid
- 40 g soda crystals in powder
- 30 g of sodium percarbonate
- 30 g baking soda

**How to make it:**

1. I put everything in a bowl and mix with a whisk.
2. I use a spray to sprinkle water on it: One or two pshits and I stir right away with a whisk to stop the reaction. I repeat once or twice until the mixture becomes lumpy and feels slightly wet to the touch.
3. I fill an ice cube tray and pack well (a spoon to pour and a fingertip to pack - be careful it's a bit corrosive, some people use a cork style utensil to pack)
4. I let it sit overnight before unmolding.
